#### General Structure

This app was create using the Creat React App tool, developed and manteined by Facebook.
I broke the test in 3 technical parts. One is the backend, build with NodeJS, part two it's the React front end and the third part it's the SQL sequence.
The Node back end consist of the 'server.js' file, which run on port 5000, request the front end on port 3000 and deal with all requests to the Country REST Api.
The bootstraped Create React App was moved to the 'client' folder.
In the client/public/src folder, it's where the index.html and the casino database sql model image are located. Under the scripts folder, are located the build and start JS files. The modules and components are locate under the components folder. The index.js file contain the API links.
